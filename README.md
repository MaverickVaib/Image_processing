# LSB_Stignography_C
Code for LSB Stignography

This code changes the least significant bit of the image matrix elements by comparing them to input data.
If data bits(binary) and image bits(binary) match there is no change otherwise the least significant bit of the image matrix element is changed to the data bit.
